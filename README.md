<br>
now you have your own free server instance to host eaglercraft. Next you need to run the setup commands:
<br>
<br>
create 2 terminal tabs and paste in the following snipits:
<br>
<br>
first tab: `cd server && sudo java -jar server.jar`
<br>
<br>
second tab: `cd bungee && sudo java -jar bungee.jar`
<br>
<br>
Now go to the ports area and forward (and make public) ports `25565` and `8081`
